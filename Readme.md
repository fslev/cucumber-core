# Cucumber Core

## Summary
Cucumber-core is a Java library meant to help you write organized and clean Cucumber tests.  
It takes over the usual features that need to be present inside a test framework, such as the _expected-actual_ comparing mechanism, read from from file functionality, it offers customized up-to-date clients to access various resources i.e databases, HTTP services, etc, and most important it offers an elegant state-sharing mechanism between Cucumber scenario steps.       
Most of these features can be imported directly in your test project and are also available as Cucumber step definitions.
